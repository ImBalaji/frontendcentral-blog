Every year, almost **_2.7 billion blog entries_** are written online annually, but almost <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/search-traffic-study/" title="Ahrefs study on search traffic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">96% of them receive no traffic from Google's organic search results</a>.

**Inadequate application of technical SEO** during website page design and development has frequently resulted in a significant decline in organic search traffic.

One important element in technical SEO is the use of <a style="box-shadow:none" href="/posts/hello-world/#essential-html5-semantic-tags-to-use-in-websites" title="Usage of HTML5 semantic elements is an important factor for technical SEO">**semantic components**</a> in your website's HTML structure. In this section, we'll talk about the value of employing semantic HTML tags and provide a list of essential elements that you should never skip when creating a website.

<p class="note">
Low rankings in Google search results may be the result of inadequate technical SEO knowledge and incorrect semantic HTML elements.

## Why CMS Plugins Alone Are Not Enough for Optimal SEO

Wix, WordPress, and SquareSpace are just a few of the CMS (Content Management System) platforms that offer both free and premium SEO plugins. Advanced functions like XML sitemap creation, meta tag management, and keyword optimization are available in these commercial plugins, and they can greatly improve the SEO of your website.

It is advised to install one of the following premium SEO plugins to help increase visibility and rankings:

- **<a href="https://yoast.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Yoast SEO">Yoast SEO</a>**
- **<a href="https://rankmath.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Rank Math">Rank Math</a>**
- **<a href="https://aioseo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="All in One SEO">All-in-one SEO</a>**
- **<a href="https://theseoframework.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="The SEO Framework">The SEO Framework</a>**

### Benefits of Using SEO Plugins

1. **Keyword Usage**: SEO plugins help to choose and use keywords to improve search engine rankings.
2. **On-page Optimization**: Many SEO plugins for WordPress, such as Yoast SEO, offer a variety of on-page optimization features, such as the ability to add meta tags, create and verify sitemaps, and optimize title tags and meta descriptions.
3. **Google Search Console Integration**: Some SEO plugins, can integrate with Google Search Console, allowing website owners to view important data such as clicks, impressions, and errors.
4. **Link management**: Some SEO plugins, such as Broken Link Checker, can check for broken links and notify website owners when they need to be fixed.

### Downsides of Using Plugins For CMS

1. **Sluggish loading time**: CMS plugins often include extensive JavaScript, CSS, and occasionally even server-side code, which can cause extra load and significantly reduce the loading speed of your website. The user experience (UX) and even your search engine rankings may suffer as a result, since <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/thread/239991563?hl=en" title="Have a go through the Q&A forum in Google Search Console" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">page speed is a direct ranking factor for SEO</a>.

2. **CMS Security Vulnerabilities**:  SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks are among the frequent web application vulnerabilities associated with CMS plugins. Bots, brute force assaults, backdoor incursions, and other security vulnerabilities are common with WordPress websites and can negatively affect many facets of your website.

   | Vulnerability Source      | Number Reported | Percentage of Total (1,779) |
   | ------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------- |
   | WordPress Core      | 23       | 1.29% |
   | WordPress Theme   | 97        | 5.45% |
   | WordPress Plugin   | 1,659        | 93.25% |

    </figcaption></figure>

3. **Complex Customization**: Plugins such as Yoast SEO are feature-rich plugins with many options, which can make it overwhelming for beginners who are new to SEO. The plugin is difficult to navigate and often leads to confusion.

4. **Cost Considerations**: Most SEO plugins offer a free license for limited basic SEO support. However, advanced SEO features are available only with the premium plan. Advanced SEO feature such as:
    <ul>
    <li>Keyword Rank Tracker</li>
    <li>Automatic Schema Implementation</li>
    <li>Long-Tail Keyword Optimization</li>
    <li>Breadcrumbs widget</li>
    <li>Google Analytics 4 Integration</li>
    <li>Custom Schema using JSON+LD/HTML</li>
    </ul>
<p class="tip">
It is always wise to avoid spending money on SEO plugins. Instead, focus on writing well optimized SEO code yourself during the web development phase, so that you build your site on a solid SEO foundation from the ground up. <br> Or you could hire a web agency with an SEO specialist to handle this for you. </span>

## What is HTML5 semantics and why is it important?

In January 2008, when HTML5 was first released. Its primary goal was to keep the web language easily readable by humans and interpretable by computers. As a result, new <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/New_HTML5_Elements" title="New Elements Introducted by W3C in HTML5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Syntactic HTML tags</a> were introduced by the World Wide Web Consortium(<a href="https://www.w3.org" title="The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C</a>). <br>
HTML semantic elements became the standard way of enabling search engine crawlers to understand what each section of a page is about. This allows search engine algorithms to better understand and process the content, rank (index) it, and render it in search results.

### Importance of Semantic HTML

- **Make accessible websites for disabled users** -
Visually impaired users use <a href="https://www.afb.org/blindness-and-low-vision/using-technology/assistive-technology-products/screen-readers" title="Screen readers for the Blind" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">screen readers</a> to get a clear understanding of the context of each section of a page on a website. <br> Screen readers use web resources such as Alt text, Aria labels, color contrast, **HTML structure (semantic tags)** to elucidate and announce them accordingly to the users.  

- **HTML Standardization and Search Engine Optimization (SEO)** -
HTML5 semantic elements were introduced to standardize the DOM structure on websites. This helps the search engines interpret the content and context of web pages better. Elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<footer>` are semantic and help search engine crawlers understand the meaning and type of content inside them.

- **Better code readability and maintainability** - Semantic HTML makes code more readable and understandable for developers, both for those who initially write it and for those who later maintain or update it.  

- **Responsive Design** - Developers can create flexible layouts using the viewport meta tag (`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`) that adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes and orientations, improving usability and accessibility on mobile devices.  

  ```html {linenos=table,hl_lines=["5"],linenostart=1}
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html lang="en">
  <head>
     <meta charset="UTF-8">
     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
     <title>Your Website Title</title>
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  </head>
   ...
   ...
  </html>
  ```

<div class="did-you-know">
<h3>Did You Know</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Negative Impact on SEO</strong>
 <p>Ignoring HTML semantic elements will cause search engine crawlers to see the page as only plain text, links, and images. They won't understand the content and context within the page, leading them to conclude it is low-quality content, which may result in a lower ranking in search results.</p></li>

<li><strong>A Case Study on Visually Impaired Users</strong>
 <p>In a study of 100 visually impaired users, it was found that they lose an average of 30.4% of their time due to <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220302591_What_Frustrates_Screen_Reader_Users_on_the_Web_A_Study_of_100_Blind_Users" title="Ignoring HTML Semantic Elements Will Frustrate Screen Reader Users" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">frustrating situations with screen readers</a>. This makes it harder for them to interpret content and navigate to other pages or sections on the web.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Code Maintenance Challenges</strong>
 A website full of non-semantic HTML tags like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> will make the code harder to maintain and update over time for developers.</p></li>
</div>
</ol>

## How do search engine crawlers work?

Every page on the web passes through three stages by the search engines' automated bots (also known as crawlers, robots, or spiders):

1. **Crawling** - Google's bot uses algorithms to crawl each URL they find on the internet and discover the content residing in it.
2. **Indexing** - Crawled web pages' texts, links, images, and videos are analyzed, indexed, and stored in clusters in large databases.
3. **Rendering** - When an end user enters a query in the browser, the search engine looks for the best matching index of web page results and displays them as search results.

## Essential HTML5 Semantic Tags to Use in Websites

There are more than 100 semantic elements declared and defined by the [WHATWG group](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/). Each HTML element falls into one or more of the following categories, which group elements with similar characteristics together:

1. Metadata Content
2. Flow Content
3. Sectioning Content
4. Heading Content
5. Phrasing Content
6. Embedded Content
7. Interactive Content

![Picture representing the categories] (<https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#kinds-of-content>)

A typical blog post may include a topic title, introduction, main article, and conclusion. It is essential to understand that each section of the article should be enclosed with the right set of HTML tags. Below are the HTML elements that will help search engines analyze and discover the contents of a blog post based on the enclosed HTML tag:

- `<header>`
- `<meta>`
- `<title>`
- `<nav>`
- `<main>`
- `<article>`
- `<section>`
- `<a>`
- `<blockquote>`
- `<code>`
- `<h1>` - `<h6>`
- `<time>`
- `<table>`
- `<ol>`
- `<ul>`
- `<figure>`
- `<figcaption>`
- `<aside>`
- `<form>`
- `<footer>`
